This repository serves as a central location for accessing TDX module releases in both separated and joined formats, along with sample scripts to assist in the installation or upgrade of TDX modules on a Linux system.

# Guidelines for Contributions: 
- Contributions to TDX module binaries, sigstruct, joined blobs, and blob_join.sh in this repository will not be reviewed or considered.
- Contributions to version_select_and_load.py will be reviewed and accepted if appropriate. However, please note that version_select_and_load.py is a sample script designed to demonstrate how to select an appropriate TDX module version and load or update the module via a tentative Linux kernel uABI proposal. It is not intended to provide full-fledged functionality. Contributions addressing security or vulnerability issues are welcome.
