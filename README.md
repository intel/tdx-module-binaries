# TDX Module Binaries Repository

Welcome to the **TDX Module Binaries** repository. This repository is designed to facilitate the re-installation of the Intel TDX module on Linux operating systems without requiring a platform reboot (TDX Module update). This approach addresses the growing size of the TDX module and aligns with Cloud Service Provider (CSP) requirements for minimal downtime during updates.

## Repository Overview

This repository offers a streamlined solution for updating the TDX module directly from the Linux OS, focusing on the case when such an update can be done in TD-Preserving way, i.e. by pausing the running TDs, performing the TDX module update and resuming the TDs. The `version_select_and_load.py` script facilitates this process by automatically selecting the most suitable TDX module version based on platform compatibility, while also allowing users to specify a desired version. Additionally, the repository contains released TDX module binaries along with their signature structures, and TDX module blob files — single Linux-compatible files created from the corresponding TDX module binaries and their signature. The `blob_join.sh` script is provided to combine the TDX module binary with its sigstruct into a single blob file, enabling users to verify the validity of the blob.
The `version_select_and_load.py` must work with WIP kernel interfaces to support TD-Preserving. The kernel patches will be submitted to the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML) soon and  the `version_select_and_load.py` serves as the user of the kernel patch.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- Linux operating system
- Git installed on your system

### Functionalities

**Clone the Repository**:
   - Run the following command to clone the repository and navigate into it:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/intel/tdx-module-binaries.git
     cd tdx-module-binaries
     ```

**Select and Load TDX Module**:
   - Use the `version_select_and_load.py` script to initiate a TDX Module update. The script will select the most appropriate version or use a specified version, ensuring compatibility. The necessary TDX Module blobs can be found under the `joined_files` directory. Blob’s structure is described in ‘blob_structure.txt’.
     ```
     ./version_select_and_load.py [options]
     ```

**Create TDX Module Blob**:
   - Use the `blob_join.sh` script to create a Linux-style TDX module blob from separate files. The resulting blobs can be found in the `joined_files` directory.
     ```
     ./blob_join.sh <path_to_bin> <path_to_sigstruct>
     ```

## Important Notes

- The repository includes a `mapping_file.json` that encodes TD-Preserving limitations and is used by the `version_select_and_load.py` tool.
  
- TDX module limitations for TD-Preserving update:
  
  | TDX Module to be Updated | Minimum Version of Existing Running TDX Module | Supported SEAMLDR Versions          |
  |--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
  | 1.5.01                   | 1.5.01                                         | 1.5.00                              |
  | 1.5.05                   | 1.5.01                                         | 1.5.00, 2.0.00                      |
  | 1.5.06                   | 1.5.01                                         | 1.5.00, 2.0.00                      |

- Performing TD Preserving during a TD Build operation might result in a corrupted TD hash in the TD attestation report. Until fixed in a future TDX module update, a host VMM can avoid the problem by not conducting a TD Preserving Update while TD Build operation is in progress.
